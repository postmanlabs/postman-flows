Postman Flows is an API workflow builder that lets you connect APIs logically. Use Flows to chain requests, handle data and create real world workflows right in your Postman workspace.

Based on the [flow-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) paradigm, a Flow is made up of several connected "Blocks" that each perform an action. Blocks have "Ports" on them that receive and transmit data to and from the block.

Postman Flow is a beta feature and is available to members of all plans **_for free_**. Head on to [Postman web app](https://go.postman.co/) or use the latest version of [Postman desktop app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/     ) to start creating Flows.

## Getting started

1. ### Open the flow builder

    You can create a new flow by going to the "Flows" tab in the left sidebar

    ![Open flow builder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28357106/137294433-e520e8e2-444c-4924-93d0-d8d71c33293c.png)

2. ### Add blocks to the flow builder

    When you open a new tab you have the Block list already open from which you can select the block to start with. You can open this Block selector by clicking on any blocks port.

    Alternatively you can also add a block by clicking on the "Add block" button in the toolbar

3. ### Run a flow

    Once You've created your flow and are ready to execute it, you can click on the start button on the bottom toolbar. This will trigger the flow to start running.
