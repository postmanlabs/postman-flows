The **Start** block is one of the primitive trigger blocks. It can be used to generate an event with a [Record](data-types.md#Record) containing the timestamp of when it was triggered.

!!!info
When a new flow is created it comes with a Start block pre-created which in most cases will be the starting point for the flow.
