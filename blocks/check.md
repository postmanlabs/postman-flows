The **Check** block accepts input from 2 sources and lets you write expressions with the new [Expression input](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-flows/discussions/124).
If the condition resolves to `True` it passes the data through otherwise burns the data away.

| Primary   | `primary`   | Data which needs to pass through if condition resolves to `True` |
| Secondary | `secondary` | Other source of data which does not pass through                 |
